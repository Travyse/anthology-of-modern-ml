# Anthology of Modern Machine Learning

A collection of important articles to be treated as a textbook. Plan to have it organized a couple of ways: 

* broad-brush topics (textbook-ish sections)
* publication date
* parent-child research developments (co-citations?)


# "Classic" ML

* Lasso/elasticnet
* random forest
* gradient boosting
* bias-variance tradeoff
* non-parametric bootstrap
* permutation testing (target shuffle)
* PCA
* ICA
* LSI
* LDA
* SVM
* NMF
* random projections
* MCMC - metropolis-hastings, HMC, reversible jump, NUTS
* SMOTE
* tSNE
* UMAP


# Network Graphs / combinatorial optimization

* Dijkstra
* A\*
* Graph anomaly detection (enron)
* Exponential random graphs
