Lots of interesting references here on error surface geometry, not sure if the paper itself is appropriate for this collection: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/a4ee59dd868ba016ed2de90d330acb6a-Paper.pdf

Test-of-time awards (and best paper awards, but be careful with these):

* ICML Test of Time Award - frustratingly, no comprehensive archive that I can find. Can search respective years for press releases and work backwards.
* NeurIPS test of time award - same thing
* ICLR Test of time award
* SIGIR test of time

# Important -- but not paradigm-altering -- papers

* AdamW - L2 regularization and weight decay are equivalent for SGD but not for adaptive methods
  * 2017 - [DECOUPLED WEIGHT DECAY REGULARIZATION](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05101.pdf) - Ilya Loshchilov, Frank Hutter

* Scree plot
  * 1966 - "The Scree Test For The Number Of Factors" - Raymond B. Cattell
